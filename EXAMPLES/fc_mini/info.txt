Select mode: 1 = absorption (abs) or 2 = emission (emi)
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Electronic adiabatic energy (in hartree): 0.1325699476419686
Electronic adiabatic energy: 29095.7403 cm^-1

Oscillator strength (dimensionless): 0.110242852

w_min(in cm^-1): 250
          S_min: 0.1

Using modes with omega >  250.0000 cm^-1 and S >  0.1000 as FC-active modes.
Number of active modes : 5
Number of sigma modes  : 61
Computed gaussian sigma: 135.2559 cm^-1

Lineshapes are ignored and, in the electric dipole approximation we can obtain Einstein coefficient of absorption(B).
B: 3.181559e+09 s gm^-1

Select absorption cross-section treatment:
1 = Assume omega/omega_I0 = 1 sharp lineshape approximation
2 = Use full omega/omega_I0 frequency dependence
Enter 1 or 2: 

######
Enter 1 or 2: 1

Using Option 1:
Assuming omega/omega_I0 = 1 (sharp lineshape approximation).
The absorption cross section has uniform scaling across the spectrum.

Characteristic peak absorption cross section: 2.879387e-16 cm^2

######
Enter 1 or 2: 2

Using Option 2:
Including full frequency-dependent factor (omega/omega_I0).
The absorption cross section now varies at each frequency point.
No single fixed peak formula applies.
