## Molecular Alignment, Transformation, Insertion, Linear interpolation, Distance and Angle toolbox

Scripts for manipulation, comparison and conversion of molecular structures (previously struc_manip).

* **M**olecular structure manipulation
* **A**lignment via a least squares fit
* **T**ransformation
* **I**nsertion of a molecule/ligand into a larger template
* **L**inear interpolation between two structures
* **D**istance measurement between two atoms
* **A**ngles and torsion angles

[Documentation (under construction)](https://felixplasser.github.io/matilda/)

These scripts were originally written about ten years ago. Some of this still has to be cleaned up.
